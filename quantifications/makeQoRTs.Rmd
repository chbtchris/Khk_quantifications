```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## Libraries
library("QoRTs")

## Sample annotations
decoder = read.table("design.txt",
                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                     header = TRUE) 

## Directory where reports are stored
directory.qorts = "/tissues/qorts/"
```

We now read the data and generate the report, with a color by group id (Genotype x Condition)

```{r report}
res <- read.qc.results.data(infile.dir = directory.qorts, 
                            decoder = decoder,
                            calc.DESeq2 = TRUE, calc.edgeR = TRUE)

makeMultiPlot.all(res, 
                  outfile.dir = "/tissues/qorts/plots_tissues/")
```
